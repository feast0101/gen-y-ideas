# Gen Y ideas Introduction: #

The basic objective of the project is to develop a POC for next generation web app in publishing domain.
The whole idea behind the project is to innovate and adapt certain open source technologies available in the cyberspace and make use of it in such a manner that the final application becomes simple, elegant and intuitive.
The system should be intelligent enough to evolve in course of time and should be scalable enough to handle large traffic at a time. It should be accessible anywhere in any device.

Finally we have chosen publishing domain because of its criticality in information dissemination and management. We would also want to fuse social networking element along with it. As we create knowledge, we want to share this with our peers.This will be a right platform to engage with.
Last but not least, as this is my first project as an all rounder; I would want to follow iterative model as SDLC to make it a success.
